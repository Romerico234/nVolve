# nVolve

## About

**nVolve** is an iOS app designed to enhance student engagement with Towson University campus events. It provides:

- **Real-time notifications** for upcoming events
- A **streamlined view** of campus events in one place
- An **interactive campus map** with markers indicating events happening that day

The app addresses the challenge of low event attendance caused by ineffective marketing and overlooked emails.

This project was developed by four awesome developers:
- Abdalla Abdelmagid
- Romerico David
- Luis Dale Gascon
- Rasheed Nolley
